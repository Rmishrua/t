    <h1>James Franklin</h1>
    <p> James Franklin has his ups and downs. He has lead the Nittany Lions to a BIG Ten championship game and to a Fiesta bowl win over Washington. But the question is still there, can he lead the Nittany Lions to wins over their rivals and go to the College Football Playoff? </p>

<h2>Penn State Football Outlook of 2019</h2>
<p> If this football program is going to defeat Ohio State, Michigan,and Michigan St, they are going to have to play football for 60 minutes each game. Every 4th quarter, they had a very good lead at the start, but as the quarter goes on, they colapse slowly and because of this, that is why they had a lot of close games.At QB, Trace Mcsorly is with the Ravens in the NFL. Trace had an ok season with Penn State, leading them to 9 wins with out the offensive weapons he had in 2017. But now here comes in Sean Clifford and Clifford started in 2018 only in blowout games. He is going to have to make good decisions and hope that his WR's don't drop balls like last year. At RB, you have Rickey Slade. Penn State has a traditions with RB's. They had Saquon Barckley for a couple of years, and Mile Sanders for 1 year. Now Rickey had good runs with the Lion's 2018, but will have to come up big for them with the run game. The WR's seem ok, ut will have to catch more passes than lass year,and with Clifford in at QB, they cannot afford to drop a lot of passes with an inexperienced QB in tough situations. I am not quite shure about the offensive line, but they will have to come up big in blocking and pass protection for the QB and RB. The defense was decent, playing good against Ohio State, Michigan St in those games, but allowed 38 POINTS to App St. There secondary is going to have to get better, and going to have to replace their defensive ends. They might not be good, but could create an upset againsts their rivals if they get their problems solved.</p>
